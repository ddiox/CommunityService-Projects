# CommunityService-Projects
This project is a community service to fulfill credit in my college. Innovating in an effort to prevent and spread Covid-19 in my neighborhood. This tool has a sensor that is used to read if there is a user’s hand. When the sensor reads the user’s hand movements, the arduino microcontroller will activate the pump to drain the water.
